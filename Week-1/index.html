<p>I’m Nobody! Who are you?<br/>
    Are you – Nobody – too?<br/>
    Then there’s a pair of us!<br/>
    Don't tell! they'd advertise – you know!</p>

    <p>How dreary – to be – Somebody!<br/>
        How public – like a Frog –<br/>
        To tell one’s name – the livelong June –<br/>
        To an admiring Bog!</p>
